What is Squeezelang ?
-------------------------
If you have HD backups of your original PS3 games, quickly you see how fast
is filled with two or three games ... and secure you've ever wondered:
are needed the 3.000 or 4.000 files inside to play ?

The reality is that not all are necessary. Many are to support multi-language
games, but like most players play in one language  ....
why do you want the rest of the languages ?

But What is it ? What does Squeezlang do?
--------------------------------------------
Squeezelang aims to help you locate the files that represent the languages of
the games and allows you to "shrink" quick and easy so reduce space, and save
the planet ("less size", "less hot", "less CO2 emissions")

How does it do?
-----------------
In essence, squeezelang is a simple program to do things with a selected files
in bulk. It currently supports:

*) Shrink: Maintains the original file and empty their contents.
*) Delete: Delete the file
*) Execute: Perform an external program as a parameter passing the selected 
file.
*) Replace: Replace the original file with the contents of an existing one.

The default is shrink. If you delete the files, some games detect its absence and 
fail.

The run option is useful, for example, to recode videos to inferior quality or 
resolution
with an external program (which reduce them)

The "Replace" option is useful when we want to replace videos others of shorter
duration, if we want to or not know how to recode.

Work for all games ?
----------------------
No. That's what I would wish. Squeezelang, find files based on their filename. 
There are
games that include all languages in a single file, so in such cases is not useful.

Is it only for PS3 games ?
--------------------------
No. Squeelang, is a "bulk file processor" (similiar to "find exec" in Unix).
Therefore It's useful even for everyday administrative actions.
Example: Do you want to delete temp files in your PC ? Search ".tmp$" and 
perform
"Delete".

Does it work in GNU/Linux ?
------------------------------
Yes. Squeeze is cross platform and is programmed using standard libraries
Lazarus and you can compile the source code to run on GNU / Linux.
Lazarus claims "Write Once, compile anywhere".

Why did you did this application ?
--------------------------------------
I was bored on a Sunday at home watching a soccer match, and I had little disk 
space. So I thought sure there is a tool for ripping games ... but I am vague, so
instead of Googling, I preferred to make a simple tool made to my taste, easy
to use and free source code for people to use, modify and / or improve.

Can I damage my Console ?
-----------------------------
No. I think so. At the worst case, if you don't select the correct patterns you can
delete useful files in the game, and the game will freeze. But you can restore
them from your original game disk.
